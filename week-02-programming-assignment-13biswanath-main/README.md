## Features
- Opens and parses JSON files.
- Extracts keys (names) and values into separate arrays.
- Includes automated tests using `doctest`.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- Visual Studio 2022 (for the provided `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files).
- JSON files located in the `TestData` folder.
